# Roadmap

This page records the app's direction: the outcomes it is working toward now, the ones
that come next, and the ones only intended for later. It sits between two other homes
and repeats neither:

- `AGENTS.md`'s `## Product` says what the app is, its core interaction, and its
  non-goals. Nothing here contradicts a non-goal; moving one is the owner's call, made
  in that section first.
- The issue tracker holds the units of work, their priority tiers, and their `blocked:`
  and `on hold` labels (`triaging-issues`). This page links issues by number and never
  copies their bodies.

It records direction and authorizes nothing. An issue is implemented because it is
filed, tiered, and picked, never because a line here names it. It is not an ADR either:
it takes no status and no number, and a decision a line depends on is recorded as an
ADR ([the index](README.md)) and linked from here. What has shipped is in
`CHANGELOG.md`, not on this page.

The owner decides what the page says; an agent proposes a change to it in a pull
request, and the change lands only once the owner has approved it.

- **Last reviewed:** 2026-09-29 — the repository has no issue tracker yet, so no line
  below links an issue

## Now

The outcomes being worked on, one to three of them. Each has its issues filed.

- **The badge shows real numbers on the owner's Mac** — the app is built and every
  gate passes, but the shipped entitlements keep it sandboxed without network access, so
  it shows `--`. Done when: after the owner applies the entitlements change
  [ADR-0002](adr/0002-sandbox-posture.md) proposes and accepts ADRs 0001–0003, `just run`
  shows the weekly percentage and the menu's reset times.

## Next

The outcomes that follow once Now's are done. An issue may already exist for one, often
parked as `on hold`; none is required.

- **The repository is on GitHub with its gates live** — so CI, not only local gates,
  guards every change. Before it moves up: the owner creates the remote, then runs
  `just labels` and `just ruleset`.

## Later

Direction the app intends to take but has not ordered. No issue is filed for a line
here, apart from a parked one that a line names.

- **Survive a change to the undocumented endpoint** — what would bring it forward: the
  endpoint's shape changing, or Anthropic publishing a supported usage API
  ([ADR-0003](adr/0003-usage-data-source.md)).
