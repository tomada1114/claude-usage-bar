## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial project scaffold from [macos-app-template](https://github.com/tomada1114/macos-app-template)
- A menu-bar agent that shows the Claude Code weekly usage limit as a rounded
  percentage inside a template-tinted outline of Clawd, Claude Code's mascot (`--`
  until the first refresh)
- A menu with the weekly and five-hour usage, their local reset times, the time of the
  last update, a line naming why the last refresh failed, and Quit (⌘Q)
- Refresh at launch and every minute, reading Claude Code's OAuth token from the
  login keychain with `/usr/bin/security` and querying Anthropic's undocumented OAuth
  usage endpoint

### Removed

- The template's example counter screen and frontmost-application example
